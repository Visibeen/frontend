## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Strategy
```javascript
// Uses existing tokens without popup
accessToken = localStorage.getItem('googleAccessToken') || 
              sessionStorage.getItem('googleAccessToken') ||
              tokenManager.get('google')?.access_token;
```

### Profile Caching
```javascript
// Caches profiles for performance
localStorage.setItem('availableGMBProfiles', JSON.stringify(profiles));
```

### Profile Data Structure
```javascript
{
  id: 'locationId',
  name: 'Business Name',
  address: 'Full Address',
  locationId: 'GMB Location ID',
  accountName: 'Account Name',
  locationData: {}, // Full GMB location object
  accountData: {}   // Full GMB account object
}
```

## User Flow

1. **Page Load**
   - Attempts to load cached profiles from localStorage
   - If no cache, uses existing auth tokens (no popup)
   - Auto-selects first available profile
   - Fetches performance data for selected profile

2. **Profile Switching**
   - User selects different profile from dropdown
   - Performance data refreshes for new profile
   - UI updates to show new profile information

3. **Navigation**
   - \"View Full Profile\" ‚Üí Business Profile page
   - \"Go to Dashboard\" ‚Üí Dashboard (when no profiles)

## Error Handling

- **No Auth Token**: Guides user to Dashboard
- **No Profiles**: Clear instructions with Dashboard link
- **API Errors**: Specific error messages with solutions
- **Performance Data Issues**: Contextual help for new businesses

## Integration with Other Pages

- **Dashboard**: Source of profile authentication and caching

- **App Context**: Shared state for selected location

This implementation ensures a seamless user experience while maintaining security and performance best practices.
